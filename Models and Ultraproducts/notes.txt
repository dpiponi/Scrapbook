*Ex 1.15*

RTP
  x ∧ (y ∨ z) = (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ z)
⇒ x ∨ (y ∧ z) = (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z)

  (x ∨ y) ∧ (x ∨ z)
= ((x ∨ y) ∧ x) ∨ ((x ∨ y) ∧ z)
= x ∨ ((x ∧ z) ∨ (y ∧ z))
= (x ∨ (x ∧ z)) ∨ (y ∧ z)
= x ∨ (y ∧ z)

*Ex 1.16*

RTP x** = x

x ∨ x* = 1
x ∧ x* = 0

x** ∨ x* = 1
x** ∧ x* = 0

(x ∧ x**) ∨ x* = (x ∨ x*) ∧ (x** ∨ x*) = 1 ∧ 1 = 1
(x ∧ x**) ∧ x* = 0

So x ∧ x** is another complement to x*.
So x ∧ x** = x**.
So x** < x.

(x ∨ x**) ∨ x* = 1
(x ∨ x**) ∧ x* = 0

So x ∨ x** is also another complement to x*.
So x ∨ x** = x**
So x** > x

So x** = x

*Ex 1.17*
B = <B,∨,∧,*,0,1> satisfies L₁,…,L₅
*Define* x≤y iff x∨y=y.
RTP <B,≤> is a complemented distributive lattice.

L₁: x ∨ y = y ∨ x, x ∧ y = y ∧ x
L₂: x ∨ (y ∨ z) = (x ∨ y) ∨ z, (x ∧ y) ∧ z = x ∧ (y ∧ z)
L₃: (x ∨ y) ∧ y = y, (x ∧ y) ∨ y = y
L₄: x∧x* = 0, x∨x* = 1
L₅: (x ∨ y) ∧ z = (x ∧ z) ∨ (y ∧ z)
    (x ∧ y) ∨ z = (x ∨ z) ∧ (y ∨ z)

Poset
Refl
Anti
Trans

Lattice
Poset where {x,y} always has sup and inf.

   Prove Poset

   Trans:
     x ≤ y & y ≤ z
   ⇒ x ∨ y = y & y ∨ z = z
   ⇒ x ∨ z = x ∨ y ∨ z = y ∨ z = z
   ⇒ x <= z

   Sym: trivial
   
   Anti: RTP x ≤ y and y ≤ x ⇒ x = y
     x ∨ y = x
     x ∨ y = y
     Trivially x = y

   Prove it's a lattice.

   Need {x,y} to have sup and inf.
   RTP x∨y is sup{x,y}
   Certainly x≤x∨y and y≤x∨y.
   Want so show x∨y is biggest.
   Suppose x ≤ z ≤ x ∨ y and y ≤ z ≤ x ∨ y
   Then:
     x∨z=z, y∨z=z
     (x∨y)∨z = z
   ⇒ x ∨ y ≤ z
   ⇒ x ∨ y = z

     x ∧ y = x
   ⇒ y ∨ (x ∧ y) = y ∨ x
   ⇒ y = y ∨ x
   ⇒ x ≤ y

   So x ∧ y is inf{x,y}

   Complemented follows from being Boolean algebra. ∎

*Ex. 1.22*

    Define ~ on 𝒫 (N):
    A ~ B if (A-B) ∪ (B-A)
    A~ is equivalence class of A.
    X = {A~ | A ⊆ N}

    Define A~ ≤ B~ iff A-B finite.

    RTP ≤ well-defined

    Suppose A ~ B
    RTP A~ ≤ C~ ⇒  B~ ≤ C~
    RTP A-C finite ⇒  B-C finite
    We know (A-B) ∪ (B-A) finite
    B-C = (A ∪ B-A)-C
        = A-C ∪ (B-A)-C
    A-C finite. B-A finite. So B-C finite. ∎

    RTP <X, ≤ > Boolean algebra
    RTP Complemented, distributive lattice.
    A is Boolean algebra
    ~ respects algebraic operations
    So A/~ is Boolean algebra

Filter
    Subsets of lattice
    Closed under ∧
    Closed "upwards"
Ideal
    Closed under ∨
    Closed "downwards"

*Ex. 2.4*

    RTP In finite lattice all filters and ideals principal.
    Let F be filter.
    F is finite so pick inf, say x.
    x ≤ all elements of F.
    Need to show x∈F.
    F closed under ∧. So trivial.
    Dualise for ideals.

filter: closed under ∧ and upwards
ideal: closed under ∨ and downwards
filter := proper filter, ie. no 0
ideal := proper ideal, ie. no 1
fip: every finite set of elts. has non-zero inf.

*Ex. 2.6*
    A ⊆ Boolean algebra B
    x ∈ B
    RTP A has fip ⇒ A ∪ {x} or A ∪ {x*} also has fip.
    RTP A has fip ⇒ ∀{a₁,…,a_n} (a₁∧a_n)∧x≠0 or ∀{a₁,…,a_n} (a₁∧a_n)∧x*≠0

    Lemma
    a ∧ x = 0 and b ∧ x* = 0 ⇒ a ∧ b = 0

    a = a ∧ (x ∨ x*) = (a ∧ x) ∨ (a ∧ x*) = a ∧ x*
    b = b ∧ (x ∨ x*) = (b ∧ x) ∨ (b ∧ x*) = b ∧ x
    a ∧ b = a ∧ b ∧ x ∧ x* = 0 ∎

    Assume converse:
    ¬(∀{a₁,…,a_n} (a₁∧a_n)∧x≠0) and ¬(∀{a₁,…,a_n} (a₁∧a_n)∧x*≠0)
    (∃{a₁,…,a_n} (a₁∧a_n)∧x=0) and (∃{a₁,…,a_n} (a₁∧a_n)∧x*=0)
    Lemma ⇒ contradiction ∎

*Ex. 2.7*
    {Aᵢ:i∈I}
    Suppose ∪Aᵢ doesn't have fip.
    Then A={a₁, …, a_n} ⊆ ∪Aᵢ with ∧aᵢ=0
    But A must be contained in some Aᵢ.
    So that Aᵢ doesn' have fip.
    Contradiction ∎

Aᵒ close A "upwards".
Aᶜ finite infima of A.
A is a base of filter F=Aᵒ
A is a sub-base if Aᶜ is a base for F. Ie. F=(Aᶜ)ᵒ. A generates F.

Defⁿ: U is an Ultrafilter in Boolean algebra B if it is a maximal proper filter
U ultrafilter iff ∀x∈B.x∈F or x*∈F

*Ex. 3.3*
    RTP Ultrafilter F ⊆ <𝒫 (X), ⊆> principal iff it contains a finite set
    If it's principal it's generated by x and contains {x}. So ⇒ trivial.
    Suppose contains a finite set {a₁, …, a_n}.
    It must contain {a₁} or {a₁}*.
    If it contains {a₁} we're done.
    If it contains {a₁}* then
        it also contains {a₁}*∧{a₁,…,a_n} = {a₂,…,a_n}
        So theorem holds by induction on size of set.

*Ex. 3.9*
    B= < 𝒫 {0,1,2}, ⊆ >
    A = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 2}}

*Ex. 4.1*
    B Boolean algebra, F filter in B.
    I = {x* | x ∈ F}
    1. RTP I is an ideal
       Ideal: closed under ∨ and downwards
       Trivial. * just swaps 0 ↔ 1, ∨ ↔ ∧
    2. RTP B' = F ∪ I is subalgebra.
       Let x ∈ F, x' ∈ F.
       x* ∈ B'
       x ∧ x' ∈ F as F closed under ∧
       x ∨ x' ∈ F as F closed upwards
       Similarly for x ∈ I and x' ∈ I
       Let x ∈ F, x' ∈ I.
       x ∧ x' ∈ I
       x ∨ x' ∈ F
       x* ∈ I
    3. RTP F is ultrafilter in B'
       Ie. F is maximal in B'
       Trivial: including any x* from I would imply extension not proper.

Defn. of hom: preserves ∧, ∨ and *. Nothing about 0 and 1.

*Ex. 4.2*
    f homomorphism B₁ → B₂

    (a) RTP f maps max of B₁ onto max of B₂

    f(1) = f(∅*) = f(∅)*
    f(1) = f(x ∨ x*) = f(x) ∨ f(x)* = 1
    Same for f(0).

    (b) x ≤ y ⇔ x = x ∧ y ⇔ f(x) = f(x) ∧ f(y) ⇔ f(x) ≤ f(y)

    (c) RTP f[B₁] is subalgebra of B₂.
        Suppose x, y ∈ B₁
        if x ∈ f[B₁] and y ∈ f[B₁] then
            x = f(u), y = f(v)
            x ∧ y = f(u) ∧ f(v) = f(u ∧ v) etc.

NOTE:
          (x ∧ y) ∧ (x* ∨ y*)
        = (x ∧ y ∧ x*) ∨ (x ∧ y ∧ y*)
        = 0
          (x ∧ y) ∨ (x* ∨ y*)
        = (x ∨ x* ∨ y*) ∧ (y ∨ x* ∨ y*)
        = 1
        Etc.
        So * is "anti-homomorphism" swapping ∧ ↔ ∨ and 0 ↔ 1

*Ex. 4.5*
    x ⊙ y = (x ∨ y*) ∧ (x* ∨ y)
    Fix F and use ~ for ~F
    x ~ y iff x ∧ f = y ∧ f for some f ∈ F

    (a) RTP x ~ y ⇒ x ⊙ y ∈ F
        Given x ∧ f = y ∧ f
        (x* ∨ f* = y* ∨ f*)
        x ⊙ y = (x ∨ y*) ∧ (x* ∨ y)

        1 = (x ∨ x*) ∧ (y ∨ y*)
          = (x ∧ y) ∨ (x ∧ y*) ∨ (x* ∧ y) ∨ (x* ∧ y*)
        
        f ∧ x ∧ y* = f ∧ y ∧ y* = 0
        f ∧ y ∧ x* = f ∧ x ∧ x* = 0

          (x ∧ y) ∨ (x* ∧ y*)
        = (x ∨ x*) ∧ (x ∨ y*) ∧ (x* ∨ y) ∧ (y ∨ y*)
        = (x ∨ y*) ∧ (x* ∨ y)

        f ∧ 1 = f ∧ ((x ∧ y) ∨ (x* ∧ y*))
              = f ∧ (x ⊙ y)
        so f ≤ x ⊙ y
        So x ⊙ y ∈ F.
        Similarly the other way.

    (b) x ⊙ y = 1
        (x ∨ y*) ∧ (x* ∨ y) = 1
        x ∨ y* = 1
        y* = x*
        x = y

|x| equiv classes under ~F
B/F = {|x| | x ∈ B} is Boolean algebra
(Confused about "onto" as we proved "onto" means iso.)

*Ex 4.6*
    RTP |x|=1 in B/F ⇔ x ∈ F

    |x| = 1 ⇔ x ~ 1 ⇔ ∃f∈F . x ∧ f = 1 ∧ f ⇔ x ∈ F.

*Lemma 4.7*
    f:B₁→B₂ homomorphism.
    F={x∈B₁|f(x)=1}
    RTP F is a filter.
    Let x ∈ F and x ≤ y.
    1 ≤ f(x) ≤ f(y).
    ∴ f(y) = 1 so y ∈ F.
    Let x, y ∈ F.
    f(x∧y) = f(x)∧f(y) = 1.
    So x∧y ∈ F.

Filter prime iff x∨y ∈ F ⇒ x∈F or y∈F

Draw pic of Theorem 4.10.

*Ex. 4.11*
    Define ~ on 𝒫 (N):
    A ~ B if (A-B) ∪ (B-A) is finite
    A~ is equivalence class of A.
    X = {A~ | A ⊆ N}

    B = <𝒫 (N), ⊆ >
    F = filter of cofinite subsets
    RTP <X , ≤ > ≃ <𝒫 (N), ⊆ >/F = B/F

    Consider obvious f:〈𝒫 (N), ⊆ 〉 → 〈X, ≤ 〉
                                   A → A~

    Want to find shell f.
    f(x) = 1 ⇔ x ~ N ⇔ (N-a) is finite ⇔ x is cofinite
    so f[𝒫 (N)] ≃ B/F where F=coofinite subsets ∎

*Lemma 5.4*
    Using this defn. of compactness of X:
    Any collection of closed subsets of X with the finite
        intersection property
    has nonempty intersection.

F converges on x if F contains every neighbourhood of x.
x adherent to F if x is in closure of every element of F.
Ultrafilter converges precisely to adherent points
X Hausdorff ⇔ every filter on X converges to at most one point
X Compact ⇔ every filter on X has at least one adherent point
          ⇔ every ultrafilter on X converges to at least one point

Boolean space = compact Hausdorff space with base of clopen sets.
Stone space S(B) = ultrafilters in B
Characteristic algebra of X, C(X) = Boolean algebra of clopen sets.

u(x) = all ultrafilters containing x
u[B] = {u(x) | x ∈ B}

Lower case (bold) c = complement in S(B)

*Theorem 6.1* Stone Representation
    B ≃ some subset of 𝒫 S(B) considered as Boolean algebra

*Theorem 6.4*
    Let X be a Boolean space
    𝒜 a subalgebra of 〈𝒫 (X), ⊆ 〉that's base of X
    Then 𝒜 = C(X)

*Theorem 6.5*
    Every cover by base has finite subcover ⇒ compact
    Suppose {Uᵢ} is cover.
    Each Uᵢ is union of base elements Uᵢ = ∪{Bᵢⱼ}
    So ∪{Bᵢⱼ} is cover.
    Has finite subcover.
    Each Bᵢⱼ in this subcover comes from some Uᵢ so these Uᵢ form
    a cover
    ∴ compact

    U ∈ u(x ∧ y) ⇔ x ∧ y ∈ U
                 ⇔ x ∈ U, y ∈ U
                 ⇔ U ∈ u(x) ∩ u(y)

    U ∈ u(x*) ⇔ x* ∈ U
              ⇔ x ∉ U (U ultrafilter)
              ⇔ U ∈ u(x)*
    U ∈ u(x ∨ y) ⇔ x ∨ y ∈ U
                 ⇔ x ∈ U or y ∈ U (U prime)
                 ⇔ U ∈ u(x) ∪ u(y)

    Need u[B] is subalgebra of 〈𝒫 (S(B)), ⊆ 〉base of S(B).
    By definition it's a base of S(B).

*Theorem 6.6* (p.35)
    Every Boolean space X homeomorphic to S(C(X))
    (S(C(X)) = ultrafilters in algebra of clopen sets in X)
    
    v(x) = {A ∈ C(X) | x ∈ A}

    For each A ∈ C(X) (ie. A a clopen set in X):
    
    {U ∈ S(C(X)) : A ∈ U}
    (Ie. all ultrafilters on clopen sets on X containing A)

    =?

    {{A' ∈ C(X) | x ∈ A'} | x ∈ A}
    (Collection of ultrafilters of clopen sets containing x,
     for each x}

    v is 1-1 and onto, so bijection.
    If it maps base of topology to base of topology then trivially
    homeomorphism.

    X boolean space (compact, Hausdorff, base of clopen sets)
    C(X) = algebra of clopen sets on X
    S(C(X)) = ultrafilters on C(X) (itself a Boolean space)
    Base on S(C(X)) = {U∈S(C(X))|x∈U} for all clopen x.
    v:X → S(C(X))
    v(x) = {A∈C(X) : x ∈ A}
    v(x) = set of clopen sets containing x.

    Is v(x) an ultrafilter?
    Closed "upwards"
    fip obvious.
    So v(x) is a filter on Boolean algebra C(X).
    Suppose u∈C(X). Then either x∈u or x ∈ u* = X-u

    RTP v is 1-1.
    Suppose x≠y.
    v(x) = {A∈C(X) : x ∈ A}
    v(y) = {A∈C(X) : y ∈ A}
    X is Hausdorff.
    So there are open sets U,V⊆X with U∩V=∅ and u∈U,v∈V.
    WLOG U and V are elements of base so are clopen.
    So v(x) must contain some clopen sets than don't contain y.

    Prove v is onto?
    U ∈ S(C(X))
    U has fip so extend to ultrafilter U' in 𝒫 (X).
    Converges to x∈X (compact, Hausdorff, ultrafilter)
    x ∈ cl A for all A∈U'
    So clearly also
    x ∈ cl A for all A∈U
    So x ∈ A for all A∈U (as A = cl A in ultrafilter of clopen sets)
    So U ⊆ v(x)
    But U is maximal so U=v(x).

    For each clopen subset A ⊆ X:
    RTP: {U ∈ S(X(C)) | A ∈ U} = {v(x) | x ∈ A}
    Ultrafilters containing A
    =
    For each x, Ultrafilter of clopen sets containing x
    LHS = element of base of S(C(X))
    {A:A∈C(X)} is base for topology of X.

    So x∧z≠x
    Let y∈F
    Consider x∧(z∧y) = (x∧z)∧y
    We know x≰z so  x∧z=0

    So x ≤ z* so z* ∈ F. ∎

    F = {y| x ≤ y} ultrafilter.
    RTP x atom.
    Suppose x not atom. Pick w≤x.
    { y | w≤y } is bigger proper filter. ∎

*Ex. 7.2*
    RTP x∈B is atom ⇔ exactly one ultrafilter U s.t. x∈U
    Suppose V is not principal filter generated by x,

RTP This defines f ⊧P:

    (b) f ⊧¬ϕ iff not f ⊧ ϕ
    (c) f ⊧ϕ ∧ ψ iff f ⊧ϕ and f ⊧ψ

    By definition agrees on pᵢ.
    f ⊧¬ϕ ⇔ f(¬ϕ) = 1 ⇔ f(ϕ)* = 1 ⇔ f(ϕ) = 0 ⇔ not f ⊧ϕ
    f ⊧ϕ∧ψ ⇔ f(ϕ∧ψ) = 1 ⇔ f(ϕ) ∧ f(ψ) = 1
           ⇔ f(ϕ) = 1 and f(ψ) = 1
           ⇔ f ⊧ϕ and f ⊧ ψ
    So agree everywhere.

    = f(((ϕ₁∧…∧ϕᵢ) ∧ ¬(ϕ→ψ)))*
    = (f(ϕ₁∧…∧ϕᵢ) ∧ f(ϕ→ψ)*)*
    = (f(ϕ₁∧…∧ϕᵢ) ∧ f(¬(ϕ∧¬ψ))*)*
    = (f(ϕ₁∧…∧ϕᵢ) ∧ f(ϕ∧¬ψ))*
    = (f(ϕ₁)∧…∧ f(ϕᵢ) ∧ f(ϕ) ∧ f(ψ)*)*
    If any f(ϕⱼ) = 0 or f(ϕ) = 0 then whole thing = 1
    If all f(ϕⱼ) = 1 and f(ϕ) = 1 then
      f(ψ) = 1 by assumption.
      So whole thing = 1 again.
    So expression is a tautology.

*Ex 2.1.5*
    Let v:𝟐ⁱ→𝟐
    RTP ∃ϕ. v=vᵩ
    For n=0, just use ⊤=p₀ ∨ ¬p₀
    Otherwise recursively define
        ψ₀ using v(…,0):𝟐⁽ⁱ⁻¹⁾→𝟐
        ψ₁ using v(…,1):𝟐⁽ⁱ⁻¹⁾→𝟐
    Let ϕ = (ψ₀ ∧ pᵢ) ∨ (ψ₁ ∧ pᵢ*)
    vᵩ(t₀,…,tᵢ) = (v(t₀,…,1) ∧ tᵢ) ∨ (v(t₀,…,0) ∧ tᵢ*)
                = v(t₀,…,tᵢ)

*Ex 2.1.9*
(a) RTP ⊦(ϕ∧ψ)→(ψ∧ϕ)
    1. (ϕ∧ψ)→ϕ (SC4a)
    2. (ϕ∧ψ)→ψ (SC4b)
    3.
