σ-algebra closed under countable ∩∪ and and complement
inner regular if m(B) is sup m(K) for all compact K⊆B
locally finite: every point has nbrhd U∋x

Radon measure = inner regular & locally finite


Met = metric spaces and short maps and radon measures with finite first moment
Short map: f:X→Y
           d_Y(f(x),f(x')) ≤ d_X(x,x')

Product metric d((x,y),(x',y')) = d(x,x')+d(y,y')

2.4 Wasserstein space
---------------------
Let X ∈ Met
PX set of probability measures on X with finite first moment
metric:
d_PX(p,q) = inf ∫ d_X(x,y)dr(x,y)
inf is over all prob measures on X×X with marginals p and q

What's shortest expected distance between points consistent with
given pair of marginals?
= sup (short f:X→ℝ) (𝔼_p[f]-𝔼_q[f])

Lemma 2.4.2
-----------
Let d(δ(x₀),p) = ∫d(x₀,x)dp(x)

f:X→Y short
p∈PX
f_*p has finite first moment
f_*:PX→PY is short

P is functor. Kantorovich functor

3.1 Power functors
------------------
Xⁿ has normalised distance
So d_Xⁿ((x₁,…),(y₁,…)) = (1/n)(d(x₁,y₁)+…)

isometric embedding X→Xⁿ is short

X_n = quotient under permutation
metric obvious min over perms
ⁿ and _n are functors

Lemma 3.1.3
-----------
When ϕ:S→T has fibers of uniform card. we have isometric embedding
-○ϕ:X^T→X^S

Def 3.1.4
---------
FinUnif
Finite sets
Morphisms of uniform card.
Cartesian product
