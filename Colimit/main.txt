σ-algebra closed under countable ∩∪ and and complement
inner regular if m(B) is sup m(K) for all compact K⊆B
locally finite: every point has nbrhd U∋x

Radon measure = inner regular & locally finite


Met = metric spaces and short maps and radon measures with finite first moment
Short map: f:X→Y
           d_Y(f(x),f(x')) ≤ d_X(x,x')

Product metric d((x,y),(x',y')) = d(x,x')+d(y,y')

2.4 Wasserstein space
---------------------
Let X ∈ Met
PX set of probability measures on X with finite first moment
metric:
d_PX(p,q) = inf ∫ d_X(x,y)dr(x,y)
inf is over all prob measures on X×X with marginals p and q

What's shortest expected distance between points consistent with
given pair of marginals?
= sup (short f:X→ℝ) (𝔼_p[f]-𝔼_q[f])

Lemma 2.4.2
-----------
Let d(δ(x₀),p) = ∫d(x₀,x)dp(x)

f:X→Y short
p∈PX
f_*p has finite first moment
f_*:PX→PY is short

P is functor. Kantorovich functor

3.1 Power functors
------------------
Xⁿ has normalised distance
So d_Xⁿ((x₁,…),(y₁,…)) = (1/n)(d(x₁,y₁)+…)

isometric embedding X→Xⁿ is short

X_n = quotient under permutation
metric obvious min over perms
ⁿ and _n are functors

Lemma 3.1.3
-----------
When ϕ:S→T has fibers of uniform card. we have isometric embedding
-○ϕ:X^T→X^S

Def 3.1.4
---------
FinUnif
Finite sets
Morphisms of uniform card.
Cartesian product

X⁽⁻⁾:FinUnifᵒᵖ→CMet power functor in 3.1.3

So suppose we have S, T

f : S → T
Xᶠ : X^(T) → X^(S)
Xᶠ ϕ = ϕ ○ f

N monoidal poset of natural numbers ℕ\{0} with n → m if m|n
And multiplication for monoidal structure

Canonical functor |·|:FinUnif → N

Also symmetrized power functor: X_(.):Nᵒᵖ

3.2 Empirical distributions
---------------------------

Def 3.2.1
X ∈ Met
S ∈ FinUnif
i^S:X^S→PX defined by

i^S(x_(-)) = 1/|S| ∑(s∈S)δ(x_s)

Def 3.2.2
---------
For n∈N the symmetric empirical distribution is the map
i_n : X_n → PX that takes
{x₁,…,x_n} to measure
i_n({x₁,…,x_n}) = (δ(x₁)+…+δ(x_n))/n

Prop 3.2.3
----------
i_n:X_n → PX is an isometric embedding

3.3 Universal property
----------------------
Def 3.3.1
---------
X complete metric space
i_n:X_n → PX
Define
I(X) = ∪{n∈N) i_n(X_n) ⊆ PX

Theorem 3.3.3
-------------
X metric space. I(X) is dense in PX

Lemma 3.3.4
-------------
X compact metric space. I(X) is dense in PX

Lemma 3.3.6
-----------
X metric space. Compactly supported prob. measures dense in PX.

This is the key result I think:

Theorem 3.3.7
-------------
PX is colimit of functor X_(-):Nᵒᵖ → CMet
                         X^(-):FinUnifᵒᵖ → Met
