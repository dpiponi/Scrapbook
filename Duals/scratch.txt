f(x) s.t. x=a, x=b
Clearly soln. is ∞ if a ≠ b

f(x)+λ(a-x)+ν(b-x)

f(x)-(λ+ν)x+λa+νb

Let ν = ε-λ

λ, ε

f(x)-εx+λa+(ε-λ)b
f(x)-εx+λ(a-b)+εb

If a-b, then taking λ to -∞ or +∞ takes L(x,λ,ν) to -∞

Dual has a=b

f(x)+λι[x∈D]

Unconstrained min: if x∈D min f(x)
                      x∉D anything

So g(λ) = min of penalise going outside of D by λ.
   g(0) = min f(x)
g(λ) < x* for all λ
In fact, as λ→∞ we get x*

Speculation
-----------

K:M→C, T:M→A
T - objective
K - constraint
Extend "objective" to C(Km',c)·Tm
c is Lagrange multiplier
Lan_K T - K is constraint, T is objective

Kan Extension

h is objective, g is constraint

This is coproduct.

Co-equaliser: a⇒b is just b is it not?

Conversely, colimit is lowest upper bound

What is a natural transformation in Pos?

Given two monotone functions F:A→B, G:A→B.
α:F ⇒ G
α(X): F(X) → G(X)
I.e. F(X) always <= G(X).
Morphisms are just ≤

Also

a : X → Y
F(X) → G(X)
  ↓F(a)  ↓G(a)
F(Y) → G(Y)

Nat trans are just functions that are always less than another

Kan extension

Lan_F X is monotone function L:B → C
∀a. X(a) ≤ LB(x)
If any other such monotone function M:B → C exists
then ∀a. L(a) ≤ M(a)
So L is a lowest upper bound of sorts.

Extends monotone function on A to smallest possibly larger function on all of B.

Say B is a point.
Then L is a constant function.
So LF is a constant function.
So C is smallest constant function.
C is *the* l.u.b.

Say B has two elememts 0 ≤ 1.
F sorts elememts of A into two "classs", class 0 and class 1.
All of class 0 ≤ all of class 1.
L picks out two elements, L(0) ≤ L(1).
I think these are the lubs of the two classes..

Consider

[0,1]  →  ℝ

  ↓ ι₀

  ℝ

Find "smallest" monotone function on ℝ ≥ identity on [0,1]
Surely
f : (-∞, 0) ↦ -∞
    [0,1] x ↦ x
    (1, ∞)  ↦ 1
