X → V factors as
X → C(V) → V

Coalgebra:
Δ:C → C⊗C
𝜖:C → K

Eg.
C = <c,s>
Δ(s) = s⊗c+c⊗s
Δ(c) = c⊗c-s⊗s
ε(s) = 0
ε(c) = 1

<Δ(s),x⊗y> = s(x+y)?

Is there such a thing as Bessel coalgebra:
ΔJ_n = ∑J_m ⊗ J_{n-m}

ΔJ₀ = … + J₁⊗J₋₁ + J₀⊗J₀ + J₋₁⊗J₁ + …

ℤ/2 → ℤ/4 via × 2 ?

1 -> 10 ?

101 -> 1010 ?

Eg. g₁ = 1 -> (1, 10, 100, 1000, …)
g₁² = 0
But there must be
    g₂ = (01, 010, 0100, …)
g₂² = g₁
Etc.
g₁g₂ = (11, 110, …)
We only need to give first element.
Left justify before adding!

Vector space V

Limit of all subspaces of V is just V again, I think.
Limit of all finite dimensional subspaces?
Well, every element is in some finite dimensional subspace, so fine.
Now do duals.
W⊂V
elts of V* restrict to elements of W*
