Chapter 1 The Picard and Jacobian Groups
========================================

Definition 1.3
--------------
Div(G) = ‚Ñ§V = {‚àë(v‚ààV) D(v)v : D(v) ‚àà ‚Ñ§}

Pic(G) = Div(F)/~

Jac(G) = Div‚Å∞(G)/~

Definition of |.|
-----------------
|D| = {E ‚àà Div(G) : E ~ D and E ‚â• 0}
Called "complete linear system of D".
Ie. all the winning positions you can get to.

Chapter 2 The Discrete Laplacian
--------------------------------
|D| = D + Prin(G)
|0| = Prin(G)

Defn 2.2
--------
œÉ:V ‚Üí ‚Ñ§ is a firing script
M(G) is abelian group of firing scripts.
œáW is characteristic function of W.

2.2 Configurations and the reduced Laplacian
--------------------------------------------
Picard group is cok(L).

Defn 2.9
--------
Fix q ‚àà V. Let V‚àº = V\{q}
A configuration wrt q of G is an element of

  Config(G,q) := Config(G) := ‚Ñ§V~ ‚äÇ ‚Ñ§V = Div(G)

We're ignoring q. So we're allowed to lend and borrow on c ‚àà Config(G) not
worrying about q at all.

Defn 2.11
---------
D|V~ config by ignoring q in D.
M~(G) ‚äÇ M(G) firing scripts not using q.

div~ : M~(G) ‚Üí Config(G)
           œÉ ‚Ü¶ div(œÉ)|V~

Chapter 3
=========
G is d-edge connected if it stays connected after the removal of d-1 edges.

3.1 greedy
----------
In debt people keep borrowing but not everyone allowed to borrow.
Greedy algorithm always succeeds if possible to win.
Loop only happens if impossible to win.

Proposition 3.1
---------------
Greedy algorithm always produces same result whatever vertex order
is chosen.

In English: plans œÉ‚ÇÅ and œÉ‚ÇÇ.
Let œÉÃÉ‚ÇÇ be œÉ‚ÇÇ where we stop just before some vertex w borrows more than in œÉ‚ÇÅ.
Then œÉÃÉ‚ÇÇ borrows same as œÉ‚ÇÅ at w, but borrows less everywhere else.
So w in plan œÉÃÉ‚ÇÇ has at least as much money as in œÉ‚ÇÅ.
So w has no debt. So why would it borrow at next step?

Proposition 3.6
---------------
Let D ‚àà Div(G) and let ‚â∫ be tree ordering rooted at q ‚àà V
Let D' be divisor obtained from D by firing non-empty S ‚äÇ VÃÉ.
Then D' ‚â∫ D.

Proof
-----
Obvious. Closest point in S to q must squirt cash out towards q.

Proposition 3.7
---------------
Choose q. Let D ‚àà Div(G).
‚àÉ! q=reduced divisor equivalent to D.

3.2 q-reduced
-------------
Legal set-firing S: each vertex loses amount = # nbrs outside S = outdeg_S(v).
This is >=0 so after set firing, money goes down.
So money just flows out of set.

q-reduced means no S ‚àå q can be set-fired.

q-reduced
---------
D(v) ‚â• 0 for all V ‚àà VÃÉ := V\{q}
Choose tree ordering based at q.
D' ‚â∫ D if D' has more cash closer to q.

Proposition 3.10
----------------
Suppose G is d-edge connected. Every effective divisor on G of degree < d is q-reduced.

Proof
-----
Suppose E has degree k < d and let S ‚äÇ VÃÉ a non-empty set of non-sources.
Edges connecting S to V\S ‚â† ‚àÖ is given by ‚àë(v‚ààS) outdeg_S(v) because
G is d-connected.
So
    ‚àë(v‚ààS) E(v) ‚â§ k < d ‚â§ ‚àë(v‚ààS) outdeg_S(v)

There must be some v ‚àà S s.t. E(v) < outdeg_S(v).
So S can't actually be fired.

Roughly: if graph is well-connected, some points are expensive to fire.
So all points in S in small divisor aren't enough to cover outgoings from S.

Proposition 3.11
----------------
G d-edge connected
D ‚àà Div(G), winnable, deg(D) < d.
|D| is single effective divisor.
For each k ‚â• d, ‚àÉ linear system of degree k with more than one effective divisor.
Ie. more than one way to win.

Proof
-----
D is winnable.
So reacahble winnable position.
Say E‚ÇÅ ~ E‚ÇÇ ~ D. (E‚ÇÅ, E‚ÇÇ effective.)
deg(E‚ÇÅ) = deg(E‚ÇÇ) = deg(D) < d
E‚ÇÅ and E‚ÇÇ are both q-reduced. By Theorem 3.2.1 they're equal

3.3 Superstable configurations
------------------------------
Defn 3.12


Chapter 4 Acyclic orientations
==============================

Corollary 4.9
-------------
Let g = |E|-|V|+1, the genus of G.
1. A superstable c is maximal iff deg(c)=g.
2. D is maximal unwinnable iff q-reduced form is c-q, c maximal superstable.
3. ùí™ ‚Ü¶ D(ùí™) bijection between acyclic orientations of G with unique source
    q and maximal unwinnable q-reduced divisors of G.
4. If D is maximal unwinnable, deg(D) = g-1. Hence deg(D) ‚â• g ‚áí D winnable. 

Chapter 5 Riemann-Roch
======================

Effective divisor: all ‚â• 0
Principal divisor: "firing script"
(Does this mean ~ 0?)

Ex 5.1
------
RTP r(D) ‚â§ max(-1,deg(D))

Definition of r(.)
------------------
For k ‚â• 0:
r(D) ‚â• k ‚áî (‚àÄE deg(E) = k ‚áí |D-E| ‚â† ‚àÖ)
r is how safe you are. r(D) ‚â• k means no divisor of degree k makes
D unwinnable.

So r(D) ‚â• k means no k-divisor kills D
   r(D) < k means there's a k-divisor that kills D
To find upper bound on r(D) find a single killer.

Suppose r(D) ‚â• k = deg(D) + 1.

r(D) ‚â• k ‚áî (‚àÄE deg(E) = deg(D) + 1 ‚áí |D-E| ‚â† ‚àÖ)
But deg(D-E) = -1
So |D-E| = ‚àÖ ‚®≥
so r(D) < deg(D) + 1
deg(D)+1 ‚â• 0 ‚áí r(D) ‚â§ deg(D)
deg(D) ‚â• -1 ‚áí r(D) ‚â§ deg(D)
If deg(D) is any lower, r(D) is still -1 by definition.

In a nutshell, you can kill a divisor by subtracting a divisor of bigger
degree.

Ex 5.2
------
RTP deg(D) = ‚àÖ ‚áí (r(D) = ‚àÖ ‚áî D principal)

deg(D) = ‚àÖ and r(D) = ‚àÖ ‚áí D principal
deg(D) = ‚àÖ and D principal ‚áí r(D) = ‚àÖ

‚áê
If D is principal then clearly winnable. So r(D) ‚â• 0
D - v unwinnable so r(D) < 1.

Conversely, suppose
deg(D) = ‚àÖ and r(D) = ‚àÖ
r(D) ‚â• 0 means D is winnable so principal

Ex 5.3
------
RTP
r(D) ‚â§ r(D + v) ‚â§ r(D) + 1 i.e. adding a dollar increases rank by at most 1

A winning play for D is a winning play for D+v so D+v is no harder than D
and so r(D) ‚â§ r(D + v)

Suppose E (of degree r(D)) kills D. Then E + v kills D + v
So r(D + v) <= deg (E + v) = r(D) + 1.

Ex 5.4
------
RTP r(D + D') ‚â• r(D) + r(D') (r(D), r(D') non-negative)

If we can win D and D' we can use sum strategy to win D + D'.

Suppose E of degree r(D) + r(D')  kills D + D'.
Split E as E' + E'' of degrees r(D) and r(D').
E' can't kill D.
E'' can't kill D'.
So actually we have a strategy to win both D - E' and D' - E''
and therefore a strategy to win D + D' - E. So D + D' is immune to
attacks of degree r(D) + r(D').

Proposition 5.5
---------------
E ‚àà Div‚Çä(G), deg(E) < d. G d-edge connected.
Then r(E) = min{E(v): v ‚àà V(G)}

Proof.
Take the minimal vertex and look what happens if you subtract v, 2v, 3v, ‚Ä¶
Safe until no more v's in E. Do it one more time and 3.11 says unwinnable.
